# Challenge 1 - Horiseon Homepage

### Project Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor an existing site given by a marketing agency to make it more accessable. 
Refactoring the code will in turn optimize the site for search engines as well as ensuring the site is accessable for people with disabilities. 
The html document is modified so that the html elements follow a semantic structure. In addition the html document is commented throughout to make it more easily understandable to those reading the code. 
Furthermore, the CSS file has been made more efficient through consolidating selectors and properties. 
The CSS selectors are also organized to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements and commented throughout.
